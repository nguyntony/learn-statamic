# Statamic

## Pages
In the control panel under the collections tab, there will be a collection with pages already made and by default there is a ‘home’ page. You are able to enter in content on this page and select a template to use.

In VScode there will be templates such as ‘home.antlers.html’ and this will be an html file template that is already there but what it is essentially is an html template. 

In the Statamic dashboard, you are able to select one of these templates that you created in VScode. If there is content that is entered inside of the dashboard you can grab that data from statamic and use it inside of your html template with the `{{ }}` In the default home page template, the textarea box is named content which is also the variable used to extract info from statamic and to use within your html template. 

## Blueprints
- determine what fields are shown in your public forms. You can configure the fields order, each field’s width, and group them into sections and tabs.
